(ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep; ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9; ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep) | awk 'NR==1{print "Before Kill:"} NR>1 && NR<=NF{print} NR==NF+2{print "After Kill:"} NR>NF+2{print}'

Here's what each part of the command does:

(ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep;: Lists all processes related to writing to the appname_log_May_05_211.log file.
ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9;: Kills all processes related to writing to the appname_log_May_05_211.log file.
ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep): Lists all remaining processes related to writing to the appname_log_May_05_211.log file after killing.
awk 'NR==1{print "Before Kill:"} NR>1 && NR<=NF{print} NR==NF+2{print "After Kill:"} NR>NF+2{print}': Adds headings and separates the output into "Before Kill" and "After Kill" sections.


Here's a descriptive name for the entire command:

"Manage and monitor vmstat logging process for appname_log_May_05_211.log"

This name captures the essence of what the command does: it manages and monitors the vmstat logging process for a specific log file named "appname_log_May_05_211.log". It checks for existing processes, terminates them if necessary, and then provides a before-and-after comparison of the process status.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
alternate to 

ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log"

kill 1234

or

kill $(pgrep -f "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log")

--------------------Count processes ------------------------------

Count processes related to a specific log file

 ps aux | grep "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep | wc -l

This command performs the following actions:

ps aux: This command lists all running processes along with detailed information about each process.
grep "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log": This filters the output of ps aux to only include lines that contain the string "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log". This typically filters for processes that are related to handling or accessing a specific log file named "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log".
grep -v grep: This further filters the output to exclude any lines that contain the string "grep", which is used for filtering processes. This step is necessary to avoid including the grep command itself in the count.
wc -l: This command counts the number of lines of input it receives.
So, the entire command counts the number of running processes that are associated with handling or accessing the log file "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log".


-------------------check if process is there or not , if present then list the the processses------------------------------------------------------

if ps aux | grep -q "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep; then ps aux | grep "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep; else echo "No processes found with name 'appname_log_May_05_211.log'"; fi

=-------------------
if ps aux | grep -q "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep; then
    ps aux | grep "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep
else
    echo "No processes found with name 'appname_log_May_05_211.log'"
fi

----------------------

ps aux | grep -q "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep: This command checks if there are any processes associated with the log file "appname_log_May_05_211.log". The -q flag makes grep quiet, meaning it won't output anything. If processes are found, grep -v grep filters out the grep command itself.
if ... then ... else ... fi: This is an if-else statement in Bash. If the condition (ps aux | grep -q "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep) evaluates to true (i.e., processes are found), then the commands after then are executed. Otherwise, the commands after else are executed.
ps aux | grep "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep: This command lists processes associated with the log file "appname_log_May_05_211.log". The first grep filters out the grep command itself.
echo "No processes found with name 'appname_log_May_05_211.log'": If no processes are found, this command prints the message "No processes found with name 'appname_log_May_05_211.log'".
So, in summary, the command checks if there are any processes associated with the specified log file. If there are, it lists them; otherwise, it prints a message indicating that no processes were found.
