(ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep; ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9; ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep) | awk 'NR==1{print "Before Kill:"} NR>1 && NR<=NF{print} NR==NF+2{print "After Kill:"} NR>NF+2{print}'

Here's what each part of the command does:

(ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep;: Lists all processes related to writing to the appname_log_May_05_211.log file.
ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9;: Kills all processes related to writing to the appname_log_May_05_211.log file.
ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep): Lists all remaining processes related to writing to the appname_log_May_05_211.log file after killing.
awk 'NR==1{print "Before Kill:"} NR>1 && NR<=NF{print} NR==NF+2{print "After Kill:"} NR>NF+2{print}': Adds headings and separates the output into "Before Kill" and "After Kill" sections.


Here's a descriptive name for the entire command:

"Manage and monitor vmstat logging process for appname_log_May_05_211.log"

This name captures the essence of what the command does: it manages and monitors the vmstat logging process for a specific log file named "appname_log_May_05_211.log". It checks for existing processes, terminates them if necessary, and then provides a before-and-after comparison of the process status.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
alternate to 

ps aux | grep "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log"

kill 1234

or

kill $(pgrep -f "vmstat 5 >> appname_log_May_05_211.log")

--------------------Count processes ------------------------------

Count processes related to a specific log file

 ps aux | grep "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep | wc -l

This command performs the following actions:

ps aux: This command lists all running processes along with detailed information about each process.
grep "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log": This filters the output of ps aux to only include lines that contain the string "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log". This typically filters for processes that are related to handling or accessing a specific log file named "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log".
grep -v grep: This further filters the output to exclude any lines that contain the string "grep", which is used for filtering processes. This step is necessary to avoid including the grep command itself in the count.
wc -l: This command counts the number of lines of input it receives.
So, the entire command counts the number of running processes that are associated with handling or accessing the log file "appname_testlog_May_05_211.log".


-------------------check if process is there or not , if present then list the the processses------------------------------------------------------

count=$(ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -c "appname_log_May_05_211.log"); if [ $count -gt 0 ]; then ps aux | grep "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep; else echo "No processes found with name 'appname_log_May_05_211.log'"; fi


1. `count=$(ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -c "appname_log_May_05_211.log")`: 
   - `ps aux`: This command lists all currently running processes.
   - `grep -v grep`: This filters out the `grep` process itself from the list of processes.
   - `grep -c "appname_log_May_05_211.log"`: This searches for processes whose command lines contain "appname_log_May_05_211.log" and counts the number of matching lines.
   - The `count=$(...)` captures the count of processes into the variable `count`.

2. `if [ $count -gt 0 ]; then ... else ... fi`:
   - This is a conditional statement that checks the value of the `count` variable. 
   - If the count is greater than 0, it means there are processes running with the specified name.
   - If the count is 0, it means no processes are running with the specified name.

3. `ps aux | grep "appname_log_May_05_211.log" | grep -v grep`:
   - If there are processes running with the specified name, this command lists them.
   - `ps aux`: Lists all processes.
   - `grep "appname_log_May_05_211.log"`: Filters processes whose command lines contain "appname_log_May_05_211.log".
   - `grep -v grep`: Filters out the `grep` process itself.

4. `echo "No processes found with name 'appname_log_May_05_211.log'"`:
   - If no processes are found with the specified name, this command prints a message indicating that no processes were found.

So, in summary, this command checks if there are any processes running with the name "appname_log_May_05_211.log". If there are, it lists them; otherwise, it prints a message stating that no such processes were found.


=------kill all occurences of appname_log_May_05_211-------------
kill $(pgrep -f "appname_log_May_05_211.log")


pgrep -f "appname_log_May_05_211.log": This command searches for processes whose command line contains the specified pattern "appname_log_May_05_211.log". Here, -f is used to match the entire command line rather than just the process name.
$(...): This is command substitution. It captures the output of the pgrep command and uses it as an argument to the kill command.
kill: This command is used to send signals to processes, typically to terminate or interrupt them.
So, in summary, the command searches for processes whose command lines contain "appname_log_May_05_211.log" and then attempts to terminate them by sending the appropriate signal. It's essentially killing any processes associated with the specified log file.
